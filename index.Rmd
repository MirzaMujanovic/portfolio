My name is Mirza MujanoviÄ‡, I am passionate data professional with expertise in marketing analytics. Originally from Tuzla, Bosnia & Herzegovina, I moved to Vienna in 2015 to pursue my bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration and marketing at Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU). During my master's, I gained valuable experience as a teaching student and remote learning assistant at the Institute for Interactive Marketing and Social Media, as well as the Institute for Marketing and Customer Analytics. Currently, I hold a Data Analyst position at Tellonym, specializing in marketing and product analytics. My diverse background equips me with strong skills in marketing and data analysis, making me well-prepared for dynamic business challenges.
